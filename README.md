Tddium Mongoid Sample Application
==================================

This is a simple Rails 3 app that uses Mongo(id) and is set up to work with
Tddium.  It is used as part of automated qualification for Tddium.

It contains very simple cucumber tests that use capybara-webkit.

It contains a basic tddium:db_hook for mongoid, but otherwise triggers default configuration.
